Patricia is a Professor of Theoretical and Computational chemistry in the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences.  Her research group  undertakes computational (quantum chemical) modelling of liquids (ionic liquids, aqueous systems, molten-salts, solvents, electrolytes, fuels, engineering fluids), solvation processes, catalysis, reactivity and bonding.  A second area is theoretical and method development within computational chemistry.
