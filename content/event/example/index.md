### SNAP inaugural workshop

Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington's Centre for Simulation, Numerical methods, Analytics and Programming (SNAP) invites you to attend its inaugural workshop.

The purpose of the workshop is to bring the community together to get to know each other, spark interdisciplinary dialogue and identify software and modelling tools which could be of use in multiple disciplines. Through multiple discussion sessions, we will also identify and refine ideas for activities and events that would benefit the SNAP community over the next year.

The event will be held on Wednesday 13 April over Zoom.

A (tentative) timetable is as follows:

- 9.30–09.45 am: Welcome and a brief update on SNAP
- 9.45–10.30 am: Short presentation session 1
- 10.30–10.45 am: Breakout session 1
- 10.45–11.15 am: Coffee break
- 11.15 am–12.15 pm: Short presentation session 2
- 12.15–12.30 pm: Breakout session 2
- 12.30–1.30 pm: Lunch break
- 1.30–2.15 pm: Short presentation session 3
- 2.15–2.30 pm: Breakout session 3
- 2.30–3 pm: Group discussion and wrap-up

The workshop is open to all academic staff and postgraduate students, and presentations are invited from academic staff and postdoctoral researchers. For presentations, we are interested in hearing about modelling/software tools that have been useful in your research/teaching group which may also appeal to staff and students in other disciplines. These will be short (10–12 minutes each) and will ideally give a brief description of the tool, how you use it, and why you think it may have appeal to other disciplines. We ask that speakers refrain from delving into specific research results.

If you are interested in attending or giving a presentation, please complete the online form. The form includes a few open-ended questions to further guide the content we would like to see from presenters. Expressions of interest for presentations should be completed by Friday 25 March. We will be in touch with those who express an interest in giving a presentation.

SNAP is also collecting information on the modelling/software tools used throughout the University. This will help to inform the capabilities across our community and help us to plan future activities. You can help by filling out this short form.
